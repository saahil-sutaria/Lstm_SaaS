## SENDING YOUR NUMPY OUTPUT TO THE CLOUD

Once you have your output .npy file generated by running feature extraction, you can follow these steps to create a request and send it to the cloud.

### 1) Creating the request

Head to the final cell in the "LSTM_Activity_Recognition_Cloud" notebook. There will be a line where you load in the .npy file:

``
a = np.load('v_ApplyEyeMakeup_g01_c01.npy')
``

Change the string inside to the local path of the .npy file you want to send for prediction.  Then, run the code; a ``request.json`` file will automatically be generated and placed inside the same directory as the notebook. 

Open a new terminal window, navigate to the directory where the ``request.json`` is stored, and type in the following command (assuming you have gcloud sdk installed):

``
gcloud ai-platform predict --model <your_cloud_model> --version <version> --json-instances request.json
``

Where ``<your_cloud_model>`` is the model you created on the Google AI Platform, and ``<version>`` is the version you created for that model.

If you do not have the Cloud SDK tools, [you can install them through this link.]([https://cloud.google.com/sdk/](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/))

After a while, the google cloud should return an array of numbers, with each number representing the predicted chance that the image falls under the corresponding label category.
